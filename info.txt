Recipe Swap:

Is going to be where people can come and look up new and fun recipes. Made by other people, and even share some of their
own recipes!!

My main goals to this is to get people to post their recipes.

Features:

Dashboard will show the news posted recipes, along with the user rating

User rating will be judged by how many recipes they post and how many likes or added on each recipe.

If you like one user over others Their post will be added to the top of list.

I'll have a area where you can post a comment to be seen by everyone about recipe.

Plus have a edit page so you can fix anything you may have messed up.
